Home stuff :  
    - Windows 11 desktop (5600x (amd) / rtx3060)  
    - Windows 11 laptop (6700H (intel) / 950m)  
both with WSL 2 with GUI acceleration integrated.  
  
(Note : WSL aka Windows Subsystem for Linux is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 11)  
That's mean i can properly developp on both Windows and Linux.  
  
Softwares used :  
- Visual Studio Code (my main software)  
- Emacs  
- Eclipse  
  
I want also to give a try to vim, for the fact that we don't need to use any export display to be used, and get the same results as VSCode.
