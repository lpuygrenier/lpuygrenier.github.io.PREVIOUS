- Official Handball referee (1 year)    
I've been doing this only 1 year officially, but I was brought to arbiter during my 15 years of Handball as a player.
I've learn a lot as a human by being a referee. You have to take decisions alone but also with your partner, even if sometimes you don't agree.
Also, learnt the fact that no matter which decision you take, there will be always someone that doesn't agree (in this case, coachs, players, the public). And that translate pretty well during informatic projets, when we need to take decisions during developpement, or having to listen to those of others.  
  
- Occasional Agent *Caisse des dépôts et consignations* (5 years, 1 month per year)    
During these summer jobs, I only did some computer inputs, sorting folders, sending letters. But i learnt about working in a huge compagny, work with colleagues as well, and the behaviour to have when working. I also learn about being organized, to work efficiency without errors.
