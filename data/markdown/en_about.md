I'm a student in Computer Sciences. In the last year of my software engineer master degree. I chose this master because I love to think about how to develop projects in a clean way. In a way where we could possibly change, adapt, easly our program. I also took a subject of high performance coding that would constrast with the good practice coding. In fact, I've learnt the gap between performances and code lisibility / sustainability.   
  
About myself, I'm a huge fan of videos games since I'm a child. I had a controller in hands even before I could walk. I did a typical scolarity until i got my *BAC*. Where I used to be really good in scientific subjects. When it was the time to go to high school, I got the choice to go in sport studies, or go to the University of Bordeaux to study computer science. I've never tried to develop before going to the university. But in fact, i always loved everythings that is related to computer. I previously did some stuff on *Scratch* and some animations with *flash*, but nothing fancy. Also I've seen my father coding at home, so I was awear of what I was going into.  

This year, I'm finishing my master degree and I'm now looking for a job as a software engineer. My goals are to work on last technologies, and constantly learn new things. I'm not afraid about having responsibility. And would love to be part of technical decisions during a project. I inspire to become a tech expert over time.
