I'm a student in Computer Sciences. In the second year of Master, speciallity Software architect. I chose this specialization because i love to think about how to develop projects in a proper way. In a way where we could possibly change easly our past program. I also took a subject of high performance coding that would constrast with the proper way of coding. In fact, i've learnt the differents gap between performance and code lisibility / sustainability.   
  
About my personality and the informatic, I'm a huge fan of videos games since i'm a child. (I had a controller in hands even before i could walk) I did a typical scolarity until i got my *BAC*. Where i used to be really good in scientific 'matieres'. When it was the time to go to high school, I got the choice to go in sport studies, or go to the University of Bordeaux to study computer science. That's what i choosen. I never tried to really develop before going to the university. But in fact, i allways loved everythings that is related to computer. I previously did some stuff on *Scratch* and some animations with *flash*, but nothing crazy. Also i saw a lot my father coding at home, so i was awear of what i was going into.  
  
I pasted succesfully my degree in Computer Science. Loved everythings i learnt during it.
For the reason i told before, i've choosen to continue into a Master in Software Architect.
Now i'm starting my last year of Master, in which i'll need to find a final stage to validate my year.
I'm going to try to get a stage with a link in software architect but i'm willing to take everything else that coud be interessting ! In fact, that is going to be my first experience in computer science industry so i'm really exited to get to work.
