let en_about = "<p>Puygrenier Leo<br /> 22 year<br /> Driver Licence<br /> Mother tongue : French  Second language : English (C1)  </p> <p>I'm a student in Computer Sciences. In the last year of my software engineer master degree. I chose this master because I love to think about how to develop projects in a clean way. In a way where we could possibly change, adapt, easly our program. I also took a subject of high performance coding that would constrast with the good practice coding. In fact, I've learnt the gap between performances and code lisibility / sustainability.   </p> <p>About myself, I'm a huge fan of videos games since I'm a child. I had a controller in hands even before I could walk. I did a typical scolarity until i got my <em>BAC</em>. Where I used to be really good in scientific subjects. When it was the time to go to high school, I got the choice to go in sport studies, or go to the University of Bordeaux to study computer science. I've never tried to develop before going to the university. But in fact, i always loved everythings that is related to computer. I previously did some stuff on <em>Scratch</em> and some animations with <em>flash</em>, but nothing fancy. Also I've seen my father coding at home, so I was awear of what I was going into.  </p> <p>This year, I'm finishing my master degree and I'm now looking for a job as a software engineer. My goals are to work on last technologies, and constantly learn new things. I'm not afraid about having responsibility. And would love to be part of technical decisions during a project. I inspire to become a tech expert over time.</p>";

I've learn a lot as a human by being a referee. You have to take decisions alone but also with your partner, even if sometimes you don't agree. Also, learnt the fact that no matter which decision you take, there will be always someone that doesn't agree (in this case, coachs, players, the public). And that translate pretty well during informatic projets, when we need to take decisions during developpement, or having to listen to those of others.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Occasional Agent <em>Caisse des dépôts et consignations</em> (5 years, 1 month per year)  <br /> During these summer jobs, I only did some computer inputs, sorting folders, sending letters. But i learnt about working in a huge compagny, work with colleagues as well, and the behaviour to have when working. I also learn about being organized, to work efficiency without errors.</p> </li> </ul>";
